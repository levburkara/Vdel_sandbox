# Joining VDEL

We welcome Post-doc, Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate applicants who have a **strong background** in:

* Mechanical engineering (design, solid mechanics, manufacturing)
* Numerical methods
* Linear algebra and vector calculus
* C/C++ or a similar scientific programming language
* Python and/or Matlab


Experience in some or all of the following fields is **highly** desirable:

- Machine learning
- Optimization
- Finite element analysis
- Physics simulations
- Computer graphics
- Geometric 3D modeling
- Computer vision

### Graduate Students and Post-Docs

Candidates must be **demonstrably proficient** in oral and written communication (prior publications, presentations etc.).

If you are interested in joining, please contact Prof. Kara with your CV. We strongly encourage you to apply if you have prior research experience (and ideally publications) in the above or related fields. 

**Graduate student applicants:** In addition to sending your CV to Prof. Kara, please visit the [Graduate Admission site](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/admission/index.html) for more info and to access the application portal.


### Undergraduate Students

Research positions in the above areas are available for highly motivated and capable undergraduate students. Please contact Prof. Kara to set up a meeting.

### What courses should I take after joining CMU?

We strongly recommend the following courses in support of your research projects. The course descriptions and schedules can be found on the [Schedule of Classes page](https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet).
